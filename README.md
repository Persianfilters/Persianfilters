Filter Persian is the name of my store and business 
brand and I am trying to develop this collection 
with the help of you, dear ones, which will result
in more sales and more revenue in addition to the 
number of customers, with a favorable salary and 
provision of a part of the expenses of a family 
and an increase in people. He is looking for a job, 
and finally, a reliable brand of factory production 
and exports, and the development of my country, and 
finally, money has a direct relationship with power, 
and power will contribute to major decisions in the country, 
and finally, I will turn the third world of colonialism and 
God-given blessings into a better world.
